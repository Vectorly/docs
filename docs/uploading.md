# Uploading Videos

You can compress videos through our [API](api.md), or through a dashboard web interface. 

Using either interface, you can:

* Upload videos from your computer, or import from a 3rd party service such as Google Drive or Dropbox
* View all videos, and their current status (e.g. processing, ready)
* Get the embed code to playback video on your app or website
* Get the links to download your video

First, you will first need to create an account by signing up [here](https://vectorly.io/signup).


## Dashboard

The easiest way to get started uploading and compressing videos is through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.vectorly.io). Once you sign up and login, you can begin uploading videos to compress.

### Uploading

Once you login to the dashboard, you can access the upload by clicking the "upload" tab in the top menu. This will bring you to the upload page (below)

Through the upload page, you can upload videos to our server from your computer, or via a 3rd party service (e.g. Dropbox or Google Drive) or via URL (e.g. AWS S3).
