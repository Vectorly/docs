Vectorly uses computer vision to convert video to a vector graphics format, reducing bitrates by an order of magnitude while improving visual quality. Vectorly was founded by a team of of computer vision engineers from MIT, who developed this codec while working on a previous startup. Vectorly's vector graphics codec is most effective for animations, sceensharing, e-sports and other computer-generated types of video content, and can operate in parallel with existing video codecs.


Vectorly's technology is still in development, and we will release a white paper and demos in Q1 2020. You can read more about the technology [here](technology.md)
