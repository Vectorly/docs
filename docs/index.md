## Getting started

Vectorly AI compression technology reduces video file-size and bandwidth-useage by up to 90% without reducing video quality. Vectorly offers a hosted video service called [Vectorly Stream](#vectorly-stream). For a demo of our technology, or if you are interested in beta-testing the Vectorly Stream platform, you can get in touch to schedule a demo here [here](https://vectorly.io/contact/)


## AI Video Compression

Developed by a team of computer vision engineers from MIT, Vectorly's [AI compression technology](technology.md)  technology leverages trained AI models and standard web technologies to upscale video content in real-time on users' devices. This lets users stream SD video, which will then be upscaled to HD quality as they watch it, enabling HD viewing experiences while using up 50% to 90% less data.

This reduction is on top of whatever codec or compression was used to originally compress/transcode the video. Vectorly's AI upscaling technology works on every major web-enabled [device/platform/browser](https://caniuse.com/webgl), is compatible with any codec, and runs at over 100fps for 720p video on most devices. You can find more details [on our technology page](technology.md)


## Vectorly Stream

 Vectorly's stream platform is a hosted video platform enabling organizations to easily take advantage of Vectorly's AI compression technology to deliver fast, high quality video to users anywhere securely.

 Along with our AI compression technology, Vectorly stream leverages multiple CDN distribution and advanced encryption to enable better-quality video experiences than Vimeo or YouTube even on poor-quality network connections. If you are interested in trying out the beta, you can reach out to us [here](https://vectorly.io/contact/)
