## Getting started

Vectorly enables fast delivery of online video over slow connections through it's patented compression technology, which can reduce bitrates and bandwidth-useage by up to 90% without reducing video quality. To get started delivering fast & data-light video, you can sign up for a a beta account [here](https://dashboard.vectorly.io/signup), or learn more  [here](compressing).


## Compression Technology

Vectorly's patented [compression technology](technology.md) was developed by 2 graduate students at MIT, who developed this codec while working on a previous startup. Vectorly's encoding technology uses computer vision to analyze and convert video to a vector-graphics based video format, reducing video bitrates by up to 98% while actually improving the video quality. Our client-side libraries leverage native vector-graphics rendering libraries to effeciently decode video. 

Our vector graphics codec is most effective for animations, sceensharing and other computer-generated types of video content. Through per-title encoding, our encoder intelligently applies vectorization to content for which it is very effective, falling back to industry-leading alternative encoders (h264, VP9, AV1) and content-adaptive settings for non-vectorizeable content.


## Vectorly's compression service

Vectorly's online video platform enables content creators to upload, compress, host and deliver videos quickly, using minimal bandwidth and buffering to their audiences. Leveraging our proprietary vector-encoding technology, industry-leading algorithms and intelligent CDN selections, videos are optimized to load faster and using less data than is possible with other video platforms such as Vimeo or YouTube.
