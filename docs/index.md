Vectorly uses computer vision to convert video to a vector graphics format, reducing bitrates by an order of magnitude while improving visual quality. Vectorly was founded by a team of of computer vision engineers from MIT, who developed this codec while working on a previous startup. Vectorly's vector graphics codec is most effective for animations, sceensharing, e-sports and other computer-generated types of video content, and can operate in parallel with existing video codecs.


Vectorly's technology is still in development. You can learn more about the technology in our [whitepaper](https://files.vectorly.io/whitepaper.pdf)
